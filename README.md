# JakeAndAmirBot
This is a chat bot written in Python. This chat bot can take queries from users relating to the scripts of Jake and Amir videos.
We made this bot because we really like Jake and Amir skits produced by CollegeHumor on Youtube. Sometimes [Jack](https://github.com/Jfleit) can't remember the exact things a character said in a skit or the title of a skit that a quote came from. This bot helps solve that problem.

We combined a spreadsheet of scripts for the show made by the amazing community at www.reddit.com/r/JakeAndAmirScripts with youtube links to create an ElasticSearch database that allows us to query for the script. We send the youtube link and a link to the script on /r/JakeAndAmirScripts back to the user if their query brings up any results. 

# What is Jake and Amir?
